The x-axis details the physical parameterizations and/or Fortran code modules executed within this time step. Right: the blue line indicates the Baseline ensemble mean at the end of the time step and the orange circle is the Test ensemble mean. The orange box highlights the threshold values corresponding to the critical P 5.0% in the two-sided t-test. For the test to pass, the orange box must overlap the blue line. Note: The orange box may appear exceptionally large as  these  values  are very close to zero and the mean \u00b1 Tc*\u03c3/\u221aN range may cross zero, where Tc is the  critical t-test value, \u03c3 is the ensemble standard deviation, N is the size of the ensemble, and \u03c3/\u221aN represents the t-test scaling parameter.",
